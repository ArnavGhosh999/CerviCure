🔍 What is Cervical Cancer?
Cervical cancer starts in the cells of the cervix — the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. It typically develops over time and can be detected early through regular screening tests. If left untreated, it can spread to other parts of the body, becoming life-threatening.

👩‍⚕️ Causes of Cervical Cancer
The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) 🦠, a sexually transmitted infection, is the leading cause of cervical cancer. While HPV is common and usually harmless, certain strains can cause abnormal cell growth in the cervix, which may develop into cancer over time.

Other factors include:

- Smoking 🚬
- Weakened immune system 🦠
- Long-term use of birth control pills 💊
- Multiple pregnancies 🤰
- Early sexual activity and multiple partners
